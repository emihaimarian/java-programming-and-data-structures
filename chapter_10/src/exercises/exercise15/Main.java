/**
 * (Geometry: the bounding rectangle) A bounding rectangle is the minimum rectangle 
 * that encloses a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, as shown in Figure 10.24d. 
 * Write a method that returns a bounding rectangle for a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, as follows:
 * public static MyRectangle2D getRectangle(double[][] points)
 * The Rectangle2D class is defined in Programming Exercise 10.13. Write a test 
 * program that prompts the user to enter five points and displays the bounding rectangleâ€™s center, width, and height.
