 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
 * to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
 * should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
 * and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 * Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in
 * degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run:
