/**
 * (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as
 * shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points
 * are placed at (200, 0) and (0, 100). Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the
 * triangle.
