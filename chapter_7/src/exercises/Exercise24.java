/**
 * (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical applications. 
 * The problem is to repeatedly pick objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly, 
 * and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit. 
 * Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another. 
 * Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked 
 *(it is possible a card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:
